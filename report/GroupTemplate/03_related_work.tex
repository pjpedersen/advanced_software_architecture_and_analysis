This Section addresses existing contributions by examining xxx in the I4.0 domain. 
In total, x papers are investigated. 

In \cite{MyRef}, experiences are elaborated on a three-layer architecture of a reconfigurable smart factory for drug packing in healthcare I4.0. 

% The paper \cite{Yazen2010Ontology} proposes an ontology agent-based architecture for inferring  new configurations to adapt to changes in manufacturing requirements and/or environment.

% In \cite{Leitao2016Specification,Angione2017Integration} an architecture for a reconfigurable production system is specified.
% Two objectives for reconfiguration and how they can be reached are described.

% Several papers \cite{Koren1999Reconfigurable,Koren2010Design,Bortolini2018Reconfigurable} describe reconfigurable manufacturing systems that are cost-effective and responsive to market changes.

% All contributions provide valuable knowledge about reconfiguration but lack a study of the software architecture perspective that specifies a quantifiable reconfigurability architectural requirement, a software architecture that adopts the architectural requirements, and evaluates the architectural requirement.
