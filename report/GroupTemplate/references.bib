abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) are an essential concept for Industry 4.0. In recent years, DT architectures and frameworks for industry have been the focus of several research initiatives regarding analytics, predictive maintenance, virtual evaluation \& verification, and fault detection \& diagnosis. However, the resource constraint and battery-driven devices in an ICPS environment are facing challenges such as short life spans due to high energy consumption, lower availability of the services, and low security capabilities. To meet these challenges, this paper identifies some critical properties for DTs, including energy efficiency, high availability \& state persistence, remote \& contention control, and security. To provide services in ICPSs, we define the concept of a DT as a proxy (DTaaP) and a four-layer architectural model for the DTaaP that enables meeting the identified properties. We present a generic proof of concept (PoC) implementation by using Eclipse Ditto, which is an open-source digital twin framework. We evaluate our artifact against the listed properties through an experimental scenario. We show that the DTaaP improves energy efficiency, that the DT can serve as an anchor point for security, and that the DTaaP provides availability and persistence for duty cycling devices. We also identify some limitations of Eclipse Ditto for PoC DTaaP implementation, which can be a focus for future research.},

abstract = {Efficiently managing the increasing complexity of Industry 4.0 system's implementation requires advanced system architectures that can handle high volumes of data and provide rapid responses. Architecture approach plays a critical role in determining the performance and scalability of software systems. This research paper explores and compares three architectural approaches—Monolithic, Microservice, and Hybrid—in the context of a Traffic Management System (TMS), which is a type of Industry 4.0 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Traditional monolithic architecture (MA) often struggles with scalability, flexibility, and performance. The microservice architecture (MSA) addresses these issues by breaking down the system into smaller, independent services, each handling a specific function. However, it introduces complexity in communication and data consistency. The proposed hybrid architecture (HA) leverages the strengths of both approaches by combining modular microservices with a shared, centralized database, and employs message-oriented middleware (MOM) protocol RabbitMQ for inter-service communication. A case study implementation of the TMS is conducted to evaluate the performance of these architectures with key performance metrics, including CPU utilization, throughput, and average error rate. Through this study, this paper explores that the HA offers a balanced solution, providing the scalability and resilience of microservices with the simplicity and centralized data management of monolithic systems.},

abstract = {The award-winning and highly influential Software Architecture in Practice, Third Edition, has been substantially revised to reflect the latest developments in the field. In a real-world setting, the book once again introduces the concepts and best practices of software architecturehow a software system is structured and how that systems elements are meant to interact. Distinct from the details of implementation, algorithm, and data representation, an architecture holds the key to achieving system quality, is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent systems, and is crucial to a software organizations business strategy. The authors have structured this edition around the concept of architecture influence cycles. Each cycle shows how architecture influences, and is influenced by, a particular context in which architecture plays a critical role. Contexts include technical environment, the life cycle of a project, an organizations business profile, and the architects professional practices. The authors also have greatly expanded their treatment of quality attributes, which remain central to their architecture philosophywith an entire chapter devoted to each attributeand broadened their treatment of architectural patterns. If you design, develop, or manage large software systems (or plan to do so), you will find this book to be a valuable resource for getting up to speed on the state of the art. Totally new material covers Contexts of software architecture: technical, project, business, and professional Architecture competence: what this means both for individuals and organizations The origins of business goals and how this affects architecture Architecturally significant requirements, and how to determine them Architecture in the life cycle, including generate-and-test as a design philosophy; architecture conformance during implementation; architecture and testing; and architecture and agile development Architecture and current technologies, such as the cloud, social networks, and end-user devices}

abstract="We study the use of formal modeling and verification techniques at an early stage in the development of safety-critical automotive products which are originally described in the domain specific architectural language EAST-ADL2. This architectural language only focuses on the structural definition of functional blocks. However, the behavior inside each functional block is not specified and that limits formal modeling and analysis of systems behaviors as well as efficient verification of safety properties. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing one modeling approach, which formally captures the behavioral execution inside each functional block and their interactions, and helps to improve the formal modeling and verification capability of EAST-ADL2: the behavior of each elementary function of EAST-ADL2 is specified in UPPAAL Timed Automata. The formal syntax and semantics are defined in order to specify the behavior model inside EAST-ADL2 and their interactions. A composition of the functional behaviors is considered a network of Timed Automata that enables us to verify behaviors of the entire system using the UPPAAL model checker. The method has been demonstrated by verifying the safety of the Brake-by-wire system design.",
