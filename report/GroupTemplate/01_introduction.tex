The structure of the paper is as follows. 
Section \ref{sec:problem} outlines the research question and the research approach. 
%to analyze the research question and evaluate our results.
Section \ref{sec:related_work} describes similar work in the field and how our contribution fits the field.
Section \ref{sec:use_case} presents a production reconfiguration use case.
The use case serves as input to specify a reconfigurability QA requirement in Section \ref{sec:qas}.
% Section \ref{sec:middleware_architecture} introduces the proposed reconfigurable middleware software architecture design.
Section \ref{sec:evaluation} evaluates the proposed middleware on realistic equipment in the I4.0 lab and analyzes the results against the stated QA requirement.
