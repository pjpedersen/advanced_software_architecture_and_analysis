The purpose of the report is to answer the following research questions, through a literature review and the development and evaluation of a prototype system, which simulates an I4.0 manufacturing line. By answering these questions, we hope to bring further insight and knowledge into the discipline of applied software architecture in the field of Industry 4.0: 

\subsection{Research Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item RQ1: How can a hybrid architecture combining event-driven messaging and microservices support real-time coordination in a heterogeneous Industry 4.0 production environment?
    \item RQ2: Which architectural tactics best achieve high availability, security, and deployability in a multi-technology stack for Industry 4.0 systems, integrating PLCs, robots, and IoT devices?
    \item RQ3: What is the impact of formal verification on reducing operational risks during changeovers and continuous deployment?
    \item RQ4: To what extent does the proposed architecture enable changeover optimization, genealogy tracking, and external API integration in practice?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Approach}
In order to answer the paper's research questions above, the following steps are taken: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use Cases
    \item Quality Attribute Scenarios
    \item Analysis and Design Modeling
