% FEEDBACK: 
% - Include code snippets
% - The woriding here is a bit confusing: "A schema registry (with, e.g., Protobuf definitions) ensures that event formats evolve in a backward-compatible manner as the system grows.", why e.g. protobuf, why not write, "the implementation uses protobuf to ensure event formats evolve in a backwards compatible manner?"
% - References to UC's are written in italic
% - Refer back to the RQ's
% - We need to consider redundancy with the tactics section, but i like section A. Perhaps, we should have 2 subsections in design analysis modeling: tactics(section B, C, D and E) and prototype implementation (section A) and then remove tactics from QAS
% - When mentioning fault injection scenarios, make a reference to the evaluation section where this is attempted
% - There is a missing subheading between section E and the concluding remarks
