The quality attribute scenarios are developed based on the method presented by Bass et al. in Chapter 3.3 of \textit{Software Architecture in Practice}\cite{Bass2012}. These scenarios define the performance, availability, and security boundaries required in this manufacturing execution context. They cover critical operations ranging from enclosure engraving, flashing devices, deployment of services to long-term data genealogy retention. The specific quality attribute scenarios chosen to drive the architecture are defined in Table \ref{table:qas}. From these scenarios, the tactics will be used to shape the architecture in section \ref{sec:design_and_analysis_modeling}.
